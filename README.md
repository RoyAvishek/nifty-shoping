# Nifty Shopping - Enhanced Dip Buying Strategy

This project contains the **OPTIMIZED** Nifty 50 dip buying strategy using **8% Anchor + 9-EMA Trailing Stop** that achieved **201.84% returns** over 5 years, outperforming the benchmark by **76.44%**.

## Strategy Overview

### üèÜ **Enhanced 8% Anchor + 9-EMA Trailing Stop Strategy**

This is the **optimal configuration** discovered through extensive backtesting:

- **Entry**: Buy 2 stocks from the 5 trading furthest below their 20-DMA
- **Position Size**: ‚Çπ15,000 per trade  
- **Exit System**: Enhanced 8% Anchor + 9-EMA Trailing Stop
- **Performance**: 201.84% total return vs 125.40% benchmark

### **Key Innovation - Enhanced Exit Logic:**

#### **Phase 1: Reaching the Anchor (0% ‚Üí 8%)**
- Monitor position until it reaches **8% profit**
- Once 8% is achieved, this becomes the **permanent minimum exit level**

#### **Phase 2: Trailing Above Anchor (8% ‚Üí Higher)**
- **Track highest high** achieved since reaching 8% anchor
- **Trail stop-loss** using 9-period EMA from current price
- **Critical Rule**: Stop-loss NEVER drops below the 8% anchor price
- **Exit trigger**: When price closes below the EMA trailing stop
