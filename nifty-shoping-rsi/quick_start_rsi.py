Nifty 50 RSI Strategy - Quick Start Guide
=======================================

This guide helps you quickly understand and run the RSI-based trading strategy.

STRATEGY OVERVIEW:
-----------------
This is a mathematical approach to trading Nifty 50 stocks using RSI (Relative Strength Index)
with Pi-based thresholds for entry, exit, and risk management.

KEY RULES:
---------
1. ENTRY: Buy when RSI < 35 (priority to lowest RSI)
2. EXIT: Sell at 6.28% profit (2 √ó Pi)
3. AVERAGING: Add more when RSI drops to 30, 25, 20, 15
4. PRICE DROP: Must have 3.14% (Pi) drop from last purchase for averaging
5. CORONA RULE: If loss > 20%, start SIP (1/15th monthly for 15 months)

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:
------------------
- Total Capital: ‚Çπ4,00,000
- Position Size: ‚Çπ10,000 per trade
- Tax Rate: 24.96% (20% STCG + 4% cess)
- Compounding: 50% reinvestment, 50% self-dividend

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
--------------------
Based on historical backtesting on 5 years of Nifty 50 data.
Results will vary based on market conditions.

HOW TO USE:
----------
1. Ensure you have the historical_data folder with Nifty 50 stock files
2. Run: python rsi_strategy.py
3. Check results folder for detailed analysis
4. Review trade log and performance charts

RISK DISCLAIMER:
---------------
This is a backtesting strategy based on historical data. Past performance
does not guarantee future results. Use at your own risk and consider
consulting a financial advisor.
