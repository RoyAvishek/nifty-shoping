📊 CORONA PHASE STATISTICS:
- Average Loss at Corona Entry: -20.8%
- Worst Loss Recorded: -21.7%
- Recovery Strategy: Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)
- Risk Mitigation: Prevents total capital loss on declining stocks

💡 CORONA RULE BENEFITS:
✅ Prevents emotional decision making during steep declines
✅ Systematic recovery approach through dollar-cost averaging
✅ Preserves capital for other opportunities
✅ Converts failing positions into long-term systematic investments

⚖️ INTERPRETATION:
Stocks in Corona phase represent positions that declined more than 20% from 
average purchase price. Instead of booking large losses, the strategy converts 
these into systematic investment plans for potential long-term recovery.

The Corona rule is a key risk management feature that differentiates this 
strategy from simple stop-loss approaches, providing a structured path for 
recovery from significant declines.
