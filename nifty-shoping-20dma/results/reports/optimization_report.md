## 🔍 WHY SIMPLE BEATS COMPLEX

### **Capital Velocity is King**
The fundamental insight from our analysis is that **capital velocity (trade frequency) drives compound growth** more than perfect exit timing in this strategy:

1. **8% Fixed Exit:** 143 trades over 5 years = High capital recycling
2. **Trailing Stops:** 55-71 trades over 5 years = Lower capital recycling

### **The Trailing Stop Trap**
All tested trailing stop mechanisms (ADX and EMA) suffered from the same issue:
- ✅ **Higher per-trade returns** (letting winners run longer)
- ❌ **Fewer total trades** (reduced capital deployment)
- ❌ **Lower overall compound growth**

### **Mathematical Reality**
- **143 trades @ 9.66% average return = 196.68% total return**
- **65 trades @ 15%+ average return = 97.74% total return**

*More frequent moderate profits > Fewer large profits*

## 💡 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### **3. Market Timing**
- Dip buying (20DMA below) provides excellent entry points
